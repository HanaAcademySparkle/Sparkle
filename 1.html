  <h2>Arduino</h2>
  <p>
    Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware
    and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a
    finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output -
    activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.
    You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to
    the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming
    language(based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.
